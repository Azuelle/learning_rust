These are code from me trying to follow the [experienmental version of **the Rust Book**](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/).
You can probably infer my progress based on the cargo packages I have made here.

Most of these code is straight up copied from the Book, while some might have also been tinkered or messed around with by me. If I make some small scale practical projects in the future I might also include them here (none yet).

So... I dunno what you're looking for or how you got to this page, but *I doubt this is what you're looking for.*
Unless you just want to check on my progress or code.

But anyways, if you find this of help, you're welcome.
